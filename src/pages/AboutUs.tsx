        The new African voice to echo the globe & inspire growth, <br />
        Introducing 'Africa Live Network', a global company that creates,
        curates, & distributes valuable African content.
        <br />
        Streaming is a platform for enlightenment & empowerment. The goal is to
        be the preeminent provider of African content throughout Africa & the
        world.
        <br />
        Connecting audiences directly to authentic African culture via films,
        documentaries, music, & events. Also uniquely connecting audiences with
        each other.
        <br />
        Africa's story has been erroneously told for many years. Attempts of
        telling the story have been made by sources that lacked the real fiber &
        background of the authentic story & what actually happened down on the
        grounds of each individual country.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond telling stories, we want to create impact by promoting products &
        profiling extraordinary compelling elements of the African continent's
        culture, biodiversity, tourism, and innovation through our Baobab
        Community.
        <br />
        The Baobab Community aims to also create an extensive networking
        platform for people in various parts of the world with an affiliation,
        interest, & connection with Africa to get a more updated reality of
        events, progress, & programs that engage, inspire, & motivate
        development around the continent. Keeping Africans connected with Africa
        no matter how far across the globe they are.
        <br />
        The Networking platform is carefully designed to host specialized groups
        of people with common interests, organizations, & individuals to access
        contacts & information on areas of interest.
        <br />
        <br />
        Africa Live Network is built upon the foundation of authentic
        storytelling of African values, history, innovations, & untold stories.
        With the sincere need for the African stories to be told by Africans
        themselves, this very platform was created to give that space for our
        Baobab Community to grow & thrive.
        <br />
        Exploring the pride of the Ubuntu philosophy which is something that has
        kept Africans united for many years.
        <br />
        Venture into the untold stories, the core of what makes Africa thrive.
        <br />
        Keep watching, the African story, authentically.
