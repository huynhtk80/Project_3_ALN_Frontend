        <br />
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile

        this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
        implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
        <br />
        As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
        mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
        online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow
        in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
        version of this privacy notice.
