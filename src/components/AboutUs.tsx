        The new African voice, Africalivenetwork. Tv is a platform for
        enlightenment and empowerment. We aim to be the preeminent provider of
        African content throughout Africa and the world. The online platform is
        founded on the foundation of authentic storytelling of African values,
        history, innovations, and untold stories. Africa Live Network was
        created knowing that a sincere need was found for the African stories to
        be told by Africans themselves. Beyond telling stories, we want to
        create impact by promoting products and profiling extraordinary
        compelling elements of the African continent's Africalivenetwork. Tv
        aims to also create an extensive networking platform for people in
        various parts of the world with an affiliation, interest, and connection
        with Africa to get a more updated reality of events, progress, and
        programs that engage, inspire, and motivate development around the
        continent. The Networking platform is carefully designed to host
        specialized groups of people with common interests, organizations, and
        individuals to access contacts and information on areas of interest.
